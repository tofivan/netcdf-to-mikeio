# netcdf-to-mikeio
netcdf to mikeio dfs2、dfs3、dfsu

Based on your description, this is a script for converting from the NetCDF format to mikeio's DFS2, DFS3, and Dfsu formats. Here is an updated summary of the script:

**Required Libraries and Dependencies:** 
The script begins by importing various required libraries, particularly xarray for handling NetCDF grid data and mikeio for processing MIKE file formats (DFS2, DFS3, and Dfsu).

**Function Definitions:** 
The script defines a series of functions used for various data processing tasks, such as data smoothing, interpolation, and replacing zero values.

**Data Reading and Settings:** 
The script sets input and output directories, from which it reads the NetCDF grid template and proceeds with subsequent operations using mikeio.

**Iterative Processing of NetCDF Files:** 
The main part of the script starts by operating on all `.nc` files in the input directory. For each file:

- It reads various datasets (e.g., velocity, temperature, and salinity).
- Sets up a new time array to interpolate data within the times.
- Calls previously defined functions to process the data.
- Constructs output data in the DFS2, DFS3, or Dfsu format using mikeio.
- Writes this data to the specified output directory.

**End Notification:** 
Upon completion, the script prints the ending time to estimate the duration of the entire conversion process.
